# Network Delay Visualizer

A web-based tool to explore how different factors contribute to end-to-end network delay.  
It breaks latency into four components:

- Transmission
- Propagation
- Processing
- Queuing

You can adjust parameters such as packet size, link rate, distance, medium, hop count, processing delay, and queuing delay. Presets for common technologies (DSL, Cable, FTTH, 4G, 5G) are included for quick reference.

## Features

- Interactive sliders and inputs for all major delay parameters
- Visual breakdown of total delay with bars and a radial gauge
- Preset scenarios (DSL, Cable, Fiber, 4G, 5G)
- Explanatory panels that show how the math works
- Responsive layout, styled with a custom theme
